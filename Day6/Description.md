# Day6 - Beginner - Python Functions and Karel

## Topics Covered:
    - Defining and Calling Python Functions
    - The Hurdles loop challenge
    - Indentation in Python
    - While Loops
    - Hurdles Challenge using while loops
    - Jumping over Hurdles with variable heights

## Project for Day 6:
The coding challenges and _Project for the day_ is done in Reeborg's Challenges. Hence, there is no proper **main.py** file for today. It just has my code in it that can be run only in **Reeborg's Challenges**

## Reeborg's Challenges:
- [Reeborg's world start](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Alone&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Falone.json)
- [The Hurdles Loop Challenge](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json)
- [While Loop Challenge](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%202&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle2.json)
- [Hurdles Challenge using While Loops](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%203&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle3.json)
- [Jumping over Hurdles with Variable Heights](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%204&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle4.json)
- [**Final Project**: Escaping the Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)

> My code for the **Final Project** is in main.py
>
> **Note:** After you have written your own code, use the worlds in the zip file, and then test your code against those worlds.
